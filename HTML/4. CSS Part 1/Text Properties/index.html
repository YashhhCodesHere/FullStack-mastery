    <h3>Author's commentary and interpretation</h3>
    <p>Child views Jack Reacher as a "happy-go-lucky guy. He has quirks and problems, but the thing is, he doesn't know he's got them. Hence, no tedious self-pity. He's smart and strong, an introvert, but any anguish he suffers is caused by others."[2] He was asked about the casting of Tom Cruise in the role of Jack Reacher.</p>
